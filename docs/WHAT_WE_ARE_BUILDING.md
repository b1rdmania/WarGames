# What We're Building

**WAR.MARKET** is a narrative trading platform that makes macro speculation accessible to crypto natives. Instead of navigating complex DeFi interfaces to express a view on geopolitical events or tech trends, users simply bet on narratives they follow—like whether Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 will succeed, or if Ethereum will flip Bitcoin. Each bet executes as a leveraged pair trade through Pear Protocol on Hyperliquid, giving users clean exposure to the narrative's outcome without needing to understand pair trading mechanics.

We're bridging the gap between "I have a thesis about the world" and "I can trade it." Crypto traders already follow macro news, geopolitical developments, and tech trends—but expressing those views is messy: multiple legs, multiple steps, lots of friction. WAR.MARKET turns that into a clean loop: authenticate with your wallet, pick a narrative, place a bet. The terminal handles the rest—opening leveraged long/short baskets, tracking P&L, and letting you cash out.

This is sports betting UX for financial markets. No jargon, no DeFi maze. Just: "Do you think this narrative plays out? Bet up or down." We curate narrative baskets (geopolitics, macro, tech) and execute them via Pear Protocol with settlement on Hyperliquid. The goal is simple: remove friction between having an opinion and putting size behind it.
