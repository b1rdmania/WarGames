# What We're Building

**WAR.MARKET** is a narrative trading platform that makes macro speculation accessible to crypto natives. Instead of navigating complex DeFi interfaces to express a view on geopolitical events or tech trends, users simply bet on narratives they follow—like whether Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 will succeed, or if Ethereum will flip Bitcoin. Each bet executes as a leveraged pair trade through Pear Protocol on Hyperliquid, giving users clean exposure to the narrative's outcome without needing to understand pair trading mechanics.

We're bridging the gap between "I have a thesis about the world" and "I can profit from that thesis." Crypto traders already follow macro news, geopolitical developments, and tech trends on Twitter—but expressing those views requires jumping between multiple protocols, managing complex positions, and often settling for imperfect proxies. WAR.MARKET turns that complexity into three clicks: bridge funds from any chain via LI.FI, authenticate with your wallet, and place a bet. The platform handles the rest—opening leveraged pair positions, tracking P&L, and letting you close with one tap.

This is sports betting UX for financial markets. No jargon, no DeFi complexity, just: "Do you think this narrative plays out? Bet up or down." We've curated 7 markets ranging from AI bubble valuations to ultra-niche geopolitical plays like the GCC's pivot from oil to tech. It's designed for mobile, built for the Hyperliquid ecosystem, and integrates both Pear Protocol's execution layer and LI.FI's cross-chain bridging to remove every possible point of friction between having an opinion and putting capital behind it.
