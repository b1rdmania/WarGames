# Voice

## Tone

**Terse.** Every word earns its place.

**Cold-blooded.** War is the input. Trade is the output.

**Confident.** We don't hedge or qualify. We state.

## Rules

1. Short sentences. Break long ones.
2. Active voice. "You click" not "the button is clicked."
3. No qualifiers. Drop "just," "simply," "basically."
4. No marketing speak. No "revolutionary" or "game-changing."
5. No emojis in product copy. Ever.

## Examples

### Good

- "Taiwan goes hot. TSMC shuts. Nvidia dies."
- "Trade the tension."
- "One thesis. One click. One position."
- "Real money. Real risk."

### Bad

- "Revolutionary trading experience for savvy investors!"
- "Easy-peasy macro plays for everyone 🚀"
- "Join thousands of traders maximizing their potential"
- "Simply click the button to start your journey"

## Error messages

Be direct. Say what happened. Say what to do.

## Buttons

Verbs. Short. Clear.

| Bad | Good |

| "Click here to connect" | "Connect" |
| "Submit your trade" | "Trade" |
| "Learn more about this" | "Details" |

## Numbers

Use numerals. No spelling out.
