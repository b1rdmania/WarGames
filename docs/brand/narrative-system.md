# Narrative system

## Core claim

war.market delivers **war-room conviction with execution clarity**.

Not casino UI. Not generic fintech polish. A terminal-native product that still reads clearly under pressure.

---

## Positioning

### Category
Narrative basket trading interface for high-conviction macro and geopolitical theses.

### Promise
You bring a thesis. We compress it into a tradable action.

### One-line
**Trade narratives. Not tickers.**

---

## Brand tension

Most products fall into one of two traps:

1. **Terminal cosplay** — looks hardcore, hard to use.
2. **Safe fintech sameness** — usable, forgettable.

war.market sits in the middle:

**Operator-grade terminal identity + production-grade UX discipline.**

---

## Narrative pillars

### 1) Name the stress
We do not sanitize market conflict. We identify tension and make it tradable.

Proof cues:
- Thesis-first market naming
- Clear trigger language
- Geopolitical and macro framing

### 2) Compress complexity
Multi-asset macro expression becomes one action without hiding risk.

Proof cues:
- Thesis to position flow
- One-click directional action (UP / DOWN)
- Structured risk disclosures

### 3) Respect competent users
We treat users as operators, not tourists.

Proof cues:
- Terse copy
- High signal density
- No gamified fluff

### 4) Show receipts
Every claim should anchor to execution evidence.

Proof cues:
- Position and P&L visibility
- Explicit status states
- Deterministic action logs

## Voice system

### Tone
Terse. Cold-blooded. Precise.

### Writing rules
- Use short declarative sentences.
- Prefer operational verbs: arm, execute, hedge, settle, unwind.
- State outcomes, do not advertise feelings.
- Remove qualifiers like "just", "simply", "basically".

### Good lines
- "Thesis armed. Awaiting entry."
- "Execution accepted. Position live."
- "Risk increased. Size down or hedge."

### Avoid
- Marketing superlatives
- Emoji in product copy
- Vague aspiration language

### Warmth guardrail
Do not confuse precision with hostility. Keep at least one human line per key page, for example:
- "You are in control."
- "Review risk before you execute."

### Partner mode (decks/GTM)
Use the same core message with less combat language for non-degen audiences:
- Product mode: "Trade the tension."
- Partner mode: "Express macro conviction with clear execution."

---

## Terminal lexicon

Use these terms consistently across product, docs, and deck:

- **thesis**: the market narrative being expressed
- **position**: active directional exposure
- **arm**: prepare a position before execution
- **execute**: send trade
- **settle**: close and realize P&L
- **unwind**: reduce or fully close exposure
- **regime**: current market state
- **risk regime**: stress profile used for risk framing
- **operator**: the user acting with intent

---

## Visual narrative guidance

### Keep
- Near-black war-room surfaces
- Lime signal color (`#02ff81`) for active/healthy states
- Monospace for labels, values, and logs
- Sharp structural chrome

### Balance
- Sans-serif for prose and educational copy
- 32px section rhythm for breathing room
- Rounded controls for clear tap targets
- Strong focus-visible states

### Motion
- Subtle scan/noise texture only
- State transitions should inform, never distract
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Accessibility commitments
- All text and critical UI states meet **WCAG AA** contrast
- All interactive controls expose a visible keyboard focus state
- No information conveyed by color alone
- Labels and status states are screen-reader friendly

### Mobile commitments
- Collapse dense tables into stacked cards on small screens
- Maintain minimum **44px** tap targets
- Keep primary action pinned or always visible in viewport
- Preserve hierarchy with spacing and type scale, not effects

### Visual don'ts
- No decorative gradients that dilute signal hierarchy
- No novelty icons that do not encode meaning
- No rounded-everything UI that erases terminal character
- No pastel accent palette drift away from signal lime
- No stacked overlays that hurt performance on mobile

---

## Messaging architecture (site-wide)

### Hero
Trade global stress with conviction.

### Support
From thesis to position in one clear action.

### Proof block
- Live markets
- Real execution path
- Position tracking
- Risk framing

### Skeptic response
"Can I trust this?" → "See the execution path, position state, and risk context in one view."

### Cold open (social)
"Macro stress is tradable."

### Conversion
Open terminal. Pick a side. Execute.

### CTA by surface
- Landing: **Open terminal**
- Trade: **Arm thesis** / **Execute position**
- Portfolio: **Review risk** / **Unwind position**
- Partner deck: **See execution model**

- Are we showing evidence of execution, not just promise?
- Is the copy terse and operator-focused?
- Is this still readable and tappable on mobile?
- Does this page meet contrast and focus-state commitments?
