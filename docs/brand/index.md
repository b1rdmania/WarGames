## The premise

Markets are war.

Not metaphorically. Structurally. Every trade has a winner and a loser. Information is asymmetric. Timing is everything. Regimes shift violently.

Most platforms pretend this isn't true. They wrap trading in friendly interfaces and optimistic language.

war.market doesn't. We name the tension. We let you take a side.

## What we do

war.market turns macro conviction into one-click basket trades.

You have a thesis. We package it. You click YES or NO. The protocol executes.

**Thesis → Position. One click.**

## Who it's for

People with opinions about the world who want to express them as trades.

- The geopolitics nerd who reads Foreign Affairs
- The macro trader who sees regime shifts
- The crypto native who understands narrative

Not everyone. Not beginners. People with conviction.

## Principles

### 1. Name the stress

Markets respond to tension. Geopolitical, economic, technological. We identify it, name it, make it tradeable.

### 2. Compress complexity

A macro thesis might involve 6+ assets. We compress that into a single action. The complexity is ours. The decision is yours.

### 3. Respect the stakes

Real money. Real risk. We don't gamify or trivialize. The interface is serious because the outcomes are serious.

### 4. Stay out of the way

You have conviction. We execute it. No newsletters, no community, no Discord alpha. Just the trade.

## The name

**WAR** — Markets as conflict. Winners and losers. Zero-sum dynamics.

**MARKET** — The arena. Also the TLD.

The dot in war.market isn't decoration. It's the domain. It's where you go.

## The feeling

When you use war.market, you should feel:

1. **Clarity** — You understand the thesis. You understand the trade.
2. **Agency** — You're taking a position on the world.
3. **Respect** — The platform treats you as competent.
4. **Edge** — A tool built for people who think like you.
