war.market turns macro conviction into one-click basket trades.

You have a thesis. "AI is a bubble." "Taiwan gets blockaded." "ETH flips BTC." These are bets on the world. Complex, multi-asset positions.

We package them. You click YES or NO. The protocol executes the basket atomically on Hyperliquid.

**Thesis → Position. One click.**

## <img src="/icons/warning.svg" class="icon-inline" /> The problem

Trading macro views is fragmented. A single thesis might require:

- Long 3 assets
- Short 4 others
- Specific weight allocation
- Leverage management
- Multiple transactions

Most people give up. The friction kills the trade.

## <img src="/icons/check.svg" class="icon-inline" /> The solution

war.market compresses this into a single action:

1. Browse markets (narratives)
2. Pick a side (YES or NO)
3. Set your size
4. Execute

Pear Protocol handles the rest. Agent wallets. Atomic execution. Position management.

## <img src="/icons/target.svg" class="icon-inline" /> Who it's for

- Macro traders who see regime shifts coming
- Geopolitics nerds who read Foreign Affairs
- Crypto natives who understand narrative better than balance sheets

Not beginners. People with conviction who want to act on it.

## <img src="/icons/layers.svg" class="icon-inline" /> How it works

```
[Your wallet] → [Pear Agent Wallet] → [Hyperliquid]
```

1. <img src="/icons/wallet.svg" class="icon-inline" /> Connect your wallet (HyperEVM)
2. <img src="/icons/lock.svg" class="icon-inline" /> Authenticate with Pear (one signature)
3. <img src="/icons/unlock.svg" class="icon-inline" /> Pear creates a non-custodial agent wallet
4. <img src="/icons/execute.svg" class="icon-inline" /> You place trades through war.market
5. <img src="/icons/send.svg" class="icon-inline" /> Pear executes basket legs on Hyperliquid
6. <img src="/icons/position.svg" class="icon-inline" /> You monitor and close from the portfolio

Your keys. Your funds. Pear just executes.
