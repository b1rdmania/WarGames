# What is war.market

war.market turns macro conviction into one-click basket trades.

You have a thesis. "AI is a bubble." "Taiwan gets blockaded." "ETH flips BTC." These are bets on the world. Complex, multi-asset positions.

We package them. You click YES or NO. The protocol executes the basket atomically on Hyperliquid.

**Thesis → Position. One click.**

## The problem

Trading macro views is fragmented. A single thesis might require:

- Long 3 assets
- Short 4 others
- Specific weight allocation
- Leverage management
- Multiple transactions

Most people give up. The friction kills the trade.

## The solution

war.market compresses this into a single action:

1. Browse markets (narratives)
2. Pick a side (YES or NO)
3. Set your size
4. Execute

Pear Protocol handles the rest. Agent wallets. Atomic execution. Position management.

## Who it's for

- Macro traders who see regime shifts coming
- Geopolitics nerds who read Foreign Affairs
- Crypto natives who understand narrative better than balance sheets

Not beginners. People with conviction who want to act on it.

## How it works

```
[Your wallet] → [Pear Agent Wallet] → [Hyperliquid]
```

1. Connect your wallet (HyperEVM)
2. Authenticate with Pear (one signature)
3. Pear creates a non-custodial agent wallet
4. You place trades through war.market
5. Pear executes basket legs on Hyperliquid
6. You monitor and close from the portfolio

Your keys. Your funds. Pear just executes.
