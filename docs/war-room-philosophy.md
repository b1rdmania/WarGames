# War Room Philosophy

## Purpose
This room compresses chaos into posture. It is not a forecast engine; it is an
operational lens that helps an operator feel the edge of the situation and act
without hesitation. We do not chase certainty. We seek readiness.

## Doctrine
We trust the operator. The interface does not narrate itself. It does not
explain every box or label every line. The room stays quiet, controlled, and
precise. If something needs attention, it is made legible by placement, motion,
or contrast, not by verbose UI.

## Data Integrity
Only real data is permitted. No mock, no placeholders, no invented signals. If a
feed cannot be sourced, it is absent. The room never lies, even when it cannot
see.

## Data as Atmosphere
Data is allowed to be atmospheric. Not every panel needs to be a KPI. Some
screens exist to create pressure and situational texture: dense, kinetic, and
alive. This is a war room, not a dashboard tutorial.

## Selective Concealment
Not everything is visible at once. Layers, tabs, collapsible blocks, and soft
disclosure are part of the design language. The room should feel deep, not
busy. Operators can drill down, but they are not forced to.

## Visual Tone
Quiet authority. Low voice. Minimal labels. High contrast for urgency only.
Typography is disciplined. Motion is restrained and purposeful.

## Attention Hierarchy
1. Breaking intelligence: what is changing now.
2. Macro pulse: what environment we are operating in.
3. Risk posture: how exposed we should be.
4. Flows and signals: what the market is doing under the surface.
5. Deep telemetry: the room’s background hum.

## Operator Role
The operator is the final layer between signal and action. The room exists to
keep them awake: glanceable, decisive, and unromantic.
