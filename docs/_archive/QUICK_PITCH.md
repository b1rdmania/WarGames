# WAR.MARKET - 30-Second Pitch

## For Hackathon Check-In

**What we're building:**
"WAR.MARKET - a narrative trading platform where users bet on geopolitical events and tech trends through leveraged pair trades."

**How it works:**
"Users connect a wallet, authenticate with Pear Protocol, and bet on narratives like 'The Flippening - will ETH overtake BTC?' which executes as a long ETH / short BTC pair trade with 3x leverage."

**Tracks:**
"Submitting to the Pear Execution API track."

**Status:**
"API integrations complete and tested. Currently doing end-to-end flow testing. UI is live and mobile-optimized."

**Target:**
"Built for crypto natives who follow macro trends - makes complex pair trading as simple as sports betting."

## Visual Hook

"It's like Polymarket for price action - bet on narratives, not just charts."
