## Brief project description (no buzzwords)

WAR.MARKET is a narrative trading UI that lets users express macro and tech theses via leveraged pair trades executed through Pear Protocol on Hyperliquid. Users connect a wallet, authenticate with an EIP‑712 signature, create/approve an agent wallet, and then place a BET UP/DOWN on a curated narrative market. The app shows whether the user is funded (spot/perp balances), displays open positions with P&L, and supports closing positions.

## What we will demo tomorrow (final submission)

1. Connect wallet
2. Authenticate with Pear (EIP‑712)
3. Agent wallet creation + approval UX
4. Show spot/perp balances and “ready to trade” gating
5. Open a position via `POST /positions`
6. Show position via `GET /positions`
7. Close via `POST /positions/{id}/close`
