## THE PROBLEM

Traders think in stories.

Markets move in pairs.

But the UI is tickers and noise.

So people trade the wrong thing.

---

## THE SOLUTION

WAR.MARKET is a war-room terminal for trading global stress.

We turn a thesis into a basket:

- LONG the winners
- SHORT the casualties

You get one position.

---

## THE STACK

- Pear Protocol execution (EIP‑712 + agent wallet)
- Hyperliquid settlement
- Next.js + wagmi terminal UI

---

## DEMO (60 SECONDS)

1) `/markets` → pick a narrative dossier  
2) `/trade` → connect → authenticate with Pear  
3) place a small bet  
4) `/portfolio` → watch P&L → cash out  

Note: iOS is gated. This is a laptop terminal.

---

## WHY JUDGES SHOULD CARE

This is real execution.

It changes behavior:

People trade narratives as a single action.
