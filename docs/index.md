## Markets are war

Not metaphorically. Structurally. Every trade has a winner and a loser. Information is asymmetric. Timing is everything. Regimes shift violently.

Most platforms pretend this isn't true. They wrap trading in friendly interfaces and optimistic language.

**war.market doesn't.** We name the tension. We let you take a side.

## What we do

war.market turns macro conviction into one-click basket trades.

You have a thesis. We package it. You click YES or NO. The protocol executes.

**Thesis → Position. One click.**

## Who it's for

People with opinions about the world who want to express them as trades.

- The geopolitics nerd who reads Foreign Affairs
- The macro trader who sees regime shifts
- The crypto native who understands narrative

Not everyone. Not beginners. **People with conviction.**
