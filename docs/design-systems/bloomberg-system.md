# System B: Bloomberg command grid

## Historical DNA

- Information hierarchy over decoration.
- Color as strict semantics, not brand mood.
- Persistent context bars and dense market tables.

## Brand fit for war.market

Best for trust, legibility, and "serious capital" posture while staying fast.

## Token direction

- Background: deep charcoal (`#111316`)
- Surface: `#171a1f`
- Divider: `#2a2f37`
- Primary action: amber (`#f59e0b`)
- Positive: green (`#22c55e`)
- Negative: red (`#ef4444`)
- Info accent: cyan (`#38bdf8`)
- Text main: `#e5e7eb`
- Text secondary: `#9ca3af`

## Typography

- Sans for headlines and prose
- Mono for numbers, symbols, timestamps
- Tight numerical alignment and tabular rhythm

## Spatial grammar

- Framed modules with title bars
- 12-column desktop grid
- 4px radius max for controls
- Dense but consistent row heights

## Component grammar

- Top status strip: session, chain, auth, latency
- Main center: sortable market table with clear row states
- Right rail: execution ticket (bet slip)
- Secondary panel: position and risk snapshots

## Interaction rules

- Primary workflow is row select -> side select -> size -> execute
- Hotkeys for navigation and submit are visible
- Inline validation near fields, not only toast
- Use compact label language, never marketing phrasing

## Mobile adaptation

- Table becomes ranked list cards with key metrics first
- Bet ticket remains sticky/pinned near viewport bottom
- Expandable detail blocks replace multi-column metadata

## Motion and effects

- Functional transitions only
- No decorative glow/noise overlays
- Emphasize state change with text + icon + color

## Anti-patterns

- Cinematic hero backgrounds
- Oversized typography that hides data
- Accent colors used without semantic meaning

## Signature pattern

Top status strip + dense, sortable market board + fixed execution ticket.
